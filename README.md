# Livewind

Livewind is a web project that fetches the weather information from different weather station sources and serves it in a single page.

This repository only holds the script that connects to every station, fetches the data and stores it. The other Livewind repositories can be found at:

* [LW API](https://github.com/voliva/lwapi): API to serve the data
* [Prelivewind](https://github.com/voliva/prelivewind): Livewind mobile web client

## Project status

Livewind has been mostly unmaintained for the last 2-3 years, but it has been kept online in https://www.livewind.es/.

This project doesn't only take time to maintain the code itself (add features, improve and fix things), but most of the weather sources have been proven unreliable and it takes more time to detect and mitigate when one of the stations stops working.

I started this project when I was at uni mostly because I found it useful for myself, so it was good spending time and money for it. However, lately, I haven't been using it that much, and this stops me from keeping the project up-to-date.

Instead of directly closing the project and website, I'd like to give it a chance for anyone to collaborate through an Open Source model. The code is pretty much as-is, and with all of the three git repositories it should be possible to build the whole livewind app. I'm willing to transfer the livewind.es domain as well.
